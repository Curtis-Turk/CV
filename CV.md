I've just completed a Makers coding bootcamp where I honed my skills as a developer learning everything from test-driven development to dependancy injection.

## Skills

Excellent Communicator 

Clear and direct, I enjoy the process of getting my ideas across and know the importance of listening.

Big picture thinker

I love getting into the details however I always have the project goals, motivations and larger system in mind when I build.
