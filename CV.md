## Makers

I've just completed a Makers academy intensive coding bootcamp where I honed my skills as a developer learning the value of test-driven, agile development with object oriented design. From SOLID principles to techniques like dependancy injection I can now confidenly navigate through complicated problem solving to come out with projects and code I feel proud of.

Makers has pushed me to be comfortable to jump in and discover new libaries or techniques, to advance my understanding by trying, failing and succeeding.

## Skills

### Excellent Communicator

Clear, direct and positive, I enjoy the process of getting my ideas across and know the importance of listening for communication.

### Big Picture Thinker

I love getting into the details to problem solve however I always have the project goals, motivations and larger system in mind when I build.

### Fast Learner

I continually re-invent myself and pick up many skills along the way, my ability to rapidly process, develop and learn is invaluable.
