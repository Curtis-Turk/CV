## Makers

I've just completed a Makers coding bootcamp where I honed my skills as a developer learning the importance of test-driven development and object oriented design. From SOLID principles to techniques like dependancy injection I can confidenly navigate through complicated problem solving to come out with projects and code I feel proud of.

## Skills

Excellent Communicator 

Clear and direct, I enjoy the process of getting my ideas across and know the importance of listening for communication.

Big picture thinker

I love getting into the details however I always have the project goals, motivations and larger system in mind when I build.
