# Curtis Turk

Hi üëã i'm a creative and dynamic full stack developer who believes in building projects that solve real world problems.

I've always wanted to find out how things work and are made, I have come full circle from building a small rpg in processing when I was 15 to years later completing a Makers academy intensive coding bootcamp. My journey in between I've built mechanical props, helped set up a gallery and repaired bicyles before my new focus on honing my skills as a developer.

At Makers I learnt the value of test-driven, agile development with object oriented design. From SOLID principles to techniques like dependancy injection I can now confidenly navigate through complicated problem solving to come out with projects and code I feel proud of. Makers has pushed me to be comfortable to jump in and discover new libaries or techniques and given me the collaborative tools to work in any team, making the most of my wide skillset and background.

## Skills 

### Excellent Communicator

Clear, direct and positive, I enjoy the process of getting my ideas across and know the importance of listening for communication.

### Ceaseless Learner

I continually re-invent myself and pick up many skills along the way, where my ability to rapidly process information to develop and learn is invaluable.

### Big Picture Thinker

I love getting into the details to problem solve however I always have the project goals, motivations and larger system in mind when I build.
