# Curtis Turk

I'm a creative and dynamic full stack developer who believes in building projects that solve real world problems.

I also have a wealth of experience from a diverse set of previous roles, such as 
- A bike mechanic where I learned how to break down, repair and fine tune a bike back to perfect running condition. 
- A commercial manager of a graphic design gallery pop-up which I had a role in everything from building stock systems for 3 lcoations of limited edition prints and stationery to initiating a complex staff rota for up to 25 staff members across the 4 floors of the space. 
- Finally to the production of live creative events; where I learned how to build props, interact with young people and teach artistic expression.

## Makers

I've just completed a Makers academy intensive coding bootcamp where I honed my skills as a developer learning the value of test-driven, agile development with object oriented design. From SOLID principles to techniques like dependancy injection I can now confidenly navigate through complicated problem solving to come out with projects and code I feel proud of.

Makers has pushed me to be comfortable to jump in and discover new libaries or techniques and given me the collaborative tools to work in any team, making the most of a wide range of skillsets and backgrounds.

## Skills 

### Excellent Communicator

Clear, direct and positive, I enjoy the process of getting my ideas across and know the importance of listening for communication.

### Ceaseless Learner

I continually re-invent myself and pick up many skills along the way, where my ability to rapidly process information to develop and learn is invaluable.

### Big Picture Thinker

I love getting into the details to problem solve however I always have the project goals, motivations and larger system in mind when I build.
