# Curtis Turk

Hi üëã I'm a creative and dynamic full stack developer who believes in building projects that solve real world problems.

I'm a recent graduate of the Makers Academy coding bootcamp. For the past 16 weeks I've been engaged in the intensive course; collaborating with peers, gaining confidence with new techniques and resulting in a varied portfolio. I began building small RPGs in processing when I was 15 years old, and completing Makers feels like I've come full circle in my journey learning about the processes behind how things work and are made. En route here I've built theatrical props, helped set up a graphic design gallery and repaired bicycles before turning my focus to honing my skills as a developer full-time.

At Makers I learnt the value of test-driven, agile development with object-oriented design. From SOLID principles to techniques like dependency injection, I can now confidently navigate through complicated problem solving to come out with projects and code I feel proud of. Makers has pushed me to be comfortable to jump in and discover new libraries or techniques and given me the collaborative tools to work in any team, making the most of my wide skill-set and background.

## Makers

16-week intensive coding bootcamp covering:

- Principles of Test-Driven Development and Object-Oriented Programming

Something I now take for granted, my introduction to TDD has been completely revolutionary for my abilities to produce systematic, incremental code that I can be confident works. Building program logic now has a satisfying rhythm supported by the natural approach of breaking aspects of the code down into objects with unique responsibilities and attributes. Throughout the course, building through tests enabled gradual step by step improvement that had the backing to ensure if code or a dependency changed some functionality, it would be found and debugged with ease.

- Writing clean, reliable and maintainable code

I realised how far I had come in this regard when I took a [tech test](https://github.com/Curtis-Turk/tech_tests/tree/main/bank) and was continually able to refactor my code to ensure single responsibility, descriptive functions and variables. I understood where to pull reused code into functions that could be called where needed.

- Git collaboration and pair programming

Throughout the course I paired with members of the cohort to accelerate learning, reduce errors and additively tackle whatever projects we were working on at the time. Collaborating through GitHub and using Git on my [final group project](https://github.com/Curtis-Turk/Travel-lite) meant that I could build out and test features of the various APIs on branches whilst we always had a current working version of our main.

- Agile development with sprints and iterative processes

My final project had one main goal; to encourage the use of alternative transportation to planes. Although I had an initial concept I wasn't clear how we were going to make that happen in reality. Which meant it was vital to use these techniques to adapt rapidly and effectively depending on the needs of the project at the time. Whether it was making an MVP, learning a new framework or a spike to understand an API; the continuous planning and reassesment sessions enabled success.

## Skills

### Excellent Communicator

Clear, direct and positive, I enjoy the process of getting my ideas across and know the importance of listening for communication.

### Ceaseless Learner

I'm continually evolving and picking up new skills. I've nurtured my ability to rapidly process information, aiding me in my mission for ongoing self-development and learning.

### Big Picture Thinker

I love getting into the details to problem solve however I always have the project goals, motivations and larger system in mind when I build.
